# Love & Surprise Proposal Web App ❤️

This is a beautiful, responsive web app to ask your special someone to be your Valentine! It features animations, a "hard-to-click" No button, and WhatsApp integration.

## 📸 Adding Your Photos

1.  **Open the `images` folder.**
2.  **Add your photos** and rename them to match the filenames below, OR update the filenames in `index.html`.
    *   `us1.jpg` - A photo of you two (Slide 1).
    *   `us2.jpg` - A photo of you two (Slide 2).
    *   `us3.jpg` - A photo of you two (Slide 3).
    *   `us4.jpg` - A photo of you two (Slide 4).
    *   `her.jpg` - A beautiful photo of her (appears after she says Yes).

> **Tip:** Make sure the photos are roughly the same size/aspect ratio for the best look!

## 📱 Setting Up WhatsApp

1.  Open `script.js` in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
2.  Find the line: `const phoneNumber = "919876543210";`
3.  **Replace** `"919876543210"` with your **actual phone number** (include country code, e.g., `91` for India, but do NOT include `+` or spaces).
